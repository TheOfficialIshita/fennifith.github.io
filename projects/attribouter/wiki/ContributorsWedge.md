A `ContributorsWedge` displays a list of child [`ContributorWedge`](ContributorWedge)s under a title, sorted by their `position` attributes. If the `repo` attribute is specified, this list will be merged with contributors from GitHub. If the `showDefaults` attribute is unspecified or `true`, it will also merge it with contributors to this repository. 

If a user with the login "TheAndroidMaster" is both in GitHub and the configuration file, its attributes will be merged so that any attributes beginning with a "^" character will override the information from GitHub, and any attributes not beginning with a "^" character will be used while the GitHub information is loading, or if the information from GitHub is not present or unavailable. See ["Overriding Resources and Providing Translations"](Overriding-Resources-and-Providing-Translations) for more information on how merges work.

## Example

```xml
<me.jfenn.attribouter.wedges.ContributorsWedge
        repo="TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter"
        title="Library Developers"
        overflow="-1" >
        
    <!-- contributors -->
        
</me.jfenn.attribouter.wedges.ContributorsWedge>
```
