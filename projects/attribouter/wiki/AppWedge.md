The `AppWedge` displays the app icon, name, version, and links to the project sites in a centered layout. By default, the icon and app name are fetched from your app's `AndroidManifest.xml`, and all other information is fetched from the GitHub API if the `repo` attribute has been specified.

## Example

```xml
<me.jfenn.attribouter.wedges.AppWedge
    repo="TheAndroidMaster/Attribouter"
    icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    description="Attribouter is a library that does things."
    websiteUrl="https://jfenn.me/Attribouter/" />
```
