The `ContributorWedge` displays a set of information about a person in a small layout. If the `bio` attribute is defined, a dialog will appear upon interaction displaying more information, such as... um... their biography... and links. If it is not defined, it will open the highest priority [`LinkWedge`](LinkWedge) child instead.

## Example

```xml
<me.jfenn.attribouter.wedges.ContributorWedge
    login="TheAndroidMaster"
    name="James Fenn"
    avatar="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13000407"
    task="Developer"
    bio="An idiot."
    blog="https://jfenn.me/"
    email="dev@jfenn.me"
    position="1" />
```
