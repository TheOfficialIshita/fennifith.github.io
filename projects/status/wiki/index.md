Welcome to the Status wiki!

For now, these pages exist only to document device-specific errors that users have encountered with Status and how they were resolved (if at all). A list of these devices is below:

- Oppo
- Xiaomi / Redmi

Status depends quite a bit on background services remaining operational _the entire time the phone is on_, which can create a lot of the issues detailed here. Another good resource for solutions to these problems is [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).
