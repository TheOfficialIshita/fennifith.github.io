## Oppo F1S

The default behavior of the phone seems to be to kill Status and disable the
accessibility service whenever the screen is turned off for a long period of
time. This can be prevented, though, by:

* pinning Status to your recent apps screen
* enabling it in the app list inside the security app's "startup manager" and
  "floating app list"
  (`com.coloros.safecenter / com.coloros.safecenter.permission.Permission`)
* make sure battery optimizations are turned off (first item in Status's setup
  screen)
* make sure the persistent notification is enabled (near the bottom of Status's
  general settings)
