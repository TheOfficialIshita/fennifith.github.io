Welcome to the Status wiki!

For now, these pages exist only to document device-specific errors that users
have encountered with Status and how they were resolved (if at all). It also
documents some of the general issues that exist across
[all Android Versions](./Android-Versions). A list of the manufacturers of
documented devices is below:

- [Oppo](./Oppo)
- [Xiaomi / Redmi](./Xiaomi)

Status depends quite a bit on background services remaining operational
_the entire time the phone is on_, which can create a lot of the issues detailed
here. Another good resource for solutions to these problems is
[dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).
