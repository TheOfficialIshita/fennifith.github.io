[This](https://theandroidmaster.github.io/GreedDetector/) is a website/quiz that supposedly measures how greedy you are. It was made for an english project, but why not, I might as well make it open source so everyone can roast me for my horrible organization and code style.

It uses firebase with a TOTALLY PRIVATE API KEY to store the data used on the statistics page.
