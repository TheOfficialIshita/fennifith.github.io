FORM Watch Face for Android Wear
================================

<img src="https://github.com/romannurik/FORMWatchFace/raw/master/art/feature.png" width="400" align="right" hspace="20">

This is a watch face for Android Wear based on the typeface used for the [FORM design conference](http://www.google.com/design/form). Many thanks to the UXA team at Google for designing the typeface and animations.
