## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I see my <b>Organizations</b> either <i>Private</i> or <i>Public</i> ones?</summary>
  <p>Open up https://github.com/settings/applications and look for FastHub, open it then scroll to Organization access and click on Grant Button, 
  alternatively login via <b>Access Token</b> which will ease this setup.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I tried to login via Access Token & OTP but it does not work?</summary>
  <p>You can't login via Access Token & OTP all together due to the lifetime of the OTP code, you'll be required to login in every few seconds.</p>
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Why my Private Repo Wiki does not show up?</summary>
  <p>It's due to FastHub scraping GitHub Wiki page & Private Repos require session token that FastHub doesn't have.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I login with Enterprise account but can't interact with anything other than my Enterprise GitHub</summary>
  <p>Well, logically, you can't access anything else other than your Enterprise, but FastHub made that possible but can't do much about it, 
  in most cases since your login credential doesn't exists in GitHub server. But in <b>few</b> 
  cases your GitHub account Oauth token will do the trick.</p>
