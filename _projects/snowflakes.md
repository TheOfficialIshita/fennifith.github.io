Snowflakes was once published on the Play Store as a completely useless app that made snowflakes appear whenever the screen changed, but it has now been removed as a result of [this really annoying thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7c4go5/is_google_play_really_going_to_suspend_all_apps/), and will not be re-uploaded.
