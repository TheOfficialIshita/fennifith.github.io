## About

Status is a status bar replacement that draws an overlay on top of the
system-generated status bar. This means that the actual status bar is only
hidden under the replacement; touch gestures are not overridden, and the
standard notification panel is still shown. It needs a lot of permissions in
order to obtain the information needed to display in the status bar. These are
listed below.

## Installation

The app is available from both Google Play and F-Droid. However, because of
Google Play's policies regarding certain app permissions and battery
optimization, some features may not be included in the Google Play version of
the app.

## Contributing

### Issues

Okay, there aren't really any guidelines over issue formatting provided that
you don't create issues that already exist and test the app thoroughly before
creating an issue (ex: try clearing the app data).

### Pull Requests

Contributions are accepted. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fennifith/Status/blob/master/./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information.

### Icons

There used to be a list of all the possible icon formats here to use as a
reference, but I stopped updating it and it's pretty useless now. If you want
to make status bar icons to add to this app, either [contact me](mailto:contact@jfenn.me)
or look in the repository for the existing icon files.
