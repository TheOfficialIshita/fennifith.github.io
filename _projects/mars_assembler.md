[MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/index.htm) is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.

MARS has been jointly developed by [Pete Sanderson](http://faculty.otterbein.edu/PSanderson/) (programming) and [Ken Vollmar](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/) (details and paperwork).

## Purpose of this repo

This is a fork of Jarrett's mirror of the MARS Assembler source code, mainly for personal use (though I am not averse to contributions) / adding more theming options. I am currently working on it across two branches:

- `clean`, which stays as close as possible to the original source code and only contains the "features" that I add
- `master`, which contains all of my changes, including a "dark theme" as the default settings.

If for some reason you would like to obtain a copy of this version of MARS without compiling it from source, you can find a .jar file [here](https://github.com/fennifith/MARS_Assembler/blob/master/../../releases/).

Huge thanks to Jarrett for maintaining the [original fork](https://github.com/JarrettBillingsley/MARS_Assembler) of MARS.
