Storage Cleaner is the only space saving app that actually does its job! :D

Okay yeah, it's a joke. It uninstalls itself. It still works though.

## What is the point?

Android has existed for a long time. There have been good phones and bad phones, with good software and bad software. Eventually someone somewhere decided that it would be a good idea to make an app that helps your phone run faster by stopping all unnecessary processes and cleaning all unneeded cache files. Whether this was necessary at the time is debatable, but their app gained a massive amount of popularity extremely quickly. If a user didn't like the performance of their Android phone, they could download this app and 'make it faster' again. Over time, a few large companies started to realize that this idea could be monetized. They essentially decided to profit off the failure of Android. Blind users wanting to make their phones run as fast as possible would download their apps and get bombarded with advertisments, questionable privacy policies, and possibly even harmful malware.

Fast forward to today. With the release of recent versions of Android such as Marshmallow or Nougat, battery draining apps are now uncommon, low storage space is rare, and frame skips are almost unheard of. With software this optimized, deleted cache files will only need to be recreated. Stopped processes will only be started again a few minutes later. The only thing an app can do to improve performance is to shut itself down when the user leaves, and only start running again when absolutely necessary. However, people still download battery savers that don't save battery life. People keep using space savers that don't save them storage space.

## Why did I make this app?

Short answer: I really really don't like bad apps. 

Long answer: By 'bad apps', I'm talking about apps that don't help the user in any way, shape, or form, and exist solely for monetization. These are usually characterized by fullscreen ads and a mixture of 1-star and 5-star reviews (with nothing inbetween). Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of them. I'm not saying they should be completely eliminated from the Play Store, but it should be generally accepted that forcing a ton of ads upon an unsuspecting user is a bad practice. Sure, some developers need money to live, but larger companies don't. This app serves as an example of an app that does absolutely nothing good for its users. It does about as much good as every other app like it. It could arguably even be better than other apps, as it uninstalls itself to 'save space' so that the user doesn't have to.
