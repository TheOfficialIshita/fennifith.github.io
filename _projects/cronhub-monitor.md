This app serves as a native Android notification client for [cronhub.io](https://cronhub.io/). Its only purpose is to deliver status notifications at the alert time specified on CronHub, using their [public API](https://docs.cronhub.io/public-api.html). It does not currently allow users to edit CronHub monitors, but that functionality may be added in the future.
