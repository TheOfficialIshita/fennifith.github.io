This is a website that displays all of my current projects and applications. As [client-side JavaScript is bad](https://jfenn.me/blog/2018-08-19-Client-Side-JavaScript/), it is now written mostly in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It does not update its content automatically, but there is [this Node.js script](https://github.com/fennifith/fennifith.github.io/blob/master/./scripts/update.js) and [a shell script](https://github.com/fennifith/fennifith.github.io/blob/master/./scripts/update.sh) that may be used to update it periodically.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fennifith/fennifith.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fennifith/fennifith.github.io)

## Building

I use [`make`](https://gnu.org/software/make/) for local testing and development. To install the project's dependencies, run `make install`. Once that is finished, simply running `make` should build and serve a local version of the site. To clean up build files and such afterwards, run `make clean`.

## CSS

This project's [CSS styles](https://jfenn.me/redirects/?t=github&d=styles) are stored in a separate repository to simplify versioning (different parts of my site use different versions of the css, so I don't have to worry about things breaking immediately if I change something). The `make install` command contains a `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the CSS.

## License

As this is my _personal_ site, I have some issues with placing the whole thing under a license for public use. However, I am trying to split it into parts so that I can open-source projects such as [bugiver](https://jfenn.me/projects/bugiver) and [photos](https://jfenn.me/projects/photos) separately. To clarify, I have no problem with borrowing small snippets from this repository for use in other projects, I am only trying to prevent people from just changing the text and claiming this entire project as their own.

If you want a template to use for your own portfolio and do not want to put in the time to write it yourself, I recommend using something like [quicksilver](https://github.com/jacksonhvisuals/quicksilver) instead. For inspiration designing your own, see [personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es/) for a list of random people's websites.

## Contributing

Pull requests / issue reports are welcome. Feel free to contact me before working on any significant changes (in fact, please do; I would prefer not to have to turn down a contribution because I don't agree with it - that would just be a waste of time and effort on the contributor's side).
