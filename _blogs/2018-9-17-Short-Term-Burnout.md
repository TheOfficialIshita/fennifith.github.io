title: "Short-Term Burnout"
---

It is currently nearing my four year anniversary since I first started learning to make apps for Android. In that time, I have published a total of 25 apps on the play store, of which 10 have been unpublished or suspended. I have created 85 repositories on GitHub, in which I've written approximately 2500 commits per year. Regardless of whether this is an accurate measurement of the actual work done, that is a lot of software. As I enjoy doing this quite a bit, I do not have much a problem with this, but it has taken up a significant part of my life. Thanks to my friends and family, it has not become my only hobby, but I am sure that I would be doing this for every minute of the day if I was given the option.
